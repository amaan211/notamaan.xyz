I knew I wanted to pursue cybersecurity as a career but getting that internship actually cemented my career path. At the time, I was new to the field (still am :D) and had very limited knowledge. Within a week of landing that internship however, I made it a personal target to get the OSCP certification within a year (which did not go as planned obviously).\nHaving a goal in mind, I started doing research about the exam. I looked at a few roadmaps and the list of topics part of the exam. I have outlined the roadmap I came up with and followed which (eventually) led me to get my certification.\nTroubles üòì I initially did some boxes but my enthusiasm started dwindling because of the office commute and the 5 day work from office policy (yes, all interns had to come in 5 days a week while full-time employees only had to come in 2 days, later increased to 3). I began working seriously on this only around December 2023 (much later than I would have liked, but oh well) once holiday season came around and there was less work.\nThe Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è Started off by doing basic tryhackme boxes to get a hang of things. See the list below:\nAgent Sudo Basic Pentesting Boiler CTF Bounty Hacker Looking Glass Mr Robot Pickle Rick Root Me Simple CTF Skynet Startup Wonderland After that, I bought an HTB subscription and started doing boxes from the NetSecFocus list. The list keeps updating as the format of the exam changes but this is the list of boxes I did at the time:\nactive arctic bashed bastard bastion beep blackfield blocky blue boardlight broker buff busqueda cozyhosting devel editorial escape flight forest friendzone grandpa granny help intelligence irked jeeves jerry keeper lame legacy magic mirai monitored networked nibbles openadmin optimum pandora postman remote sau sauna scrambled servmon shocker soccer streamio support swagshop tabby timelapse traverxec updown valentine The Grind Phase üí™ After only doing 55 HTB Boxes by June 2024 (yikes!), I realized I had to grind out more hours if I were to get my OSCP before 31st December 2024 which was my new deadline. At this point, I was staying back after office to get some hours in and staying at home during weekends.\nWhile working on my Roadmap, I deviated from the path and did a couple of courses like the paid AD course by Bitten Tech (a youtuber) but to be honest I did not find it to be useful because the information given in the course was unstructured and not completely aligned with OSCP.\nEpic Realization üí° The biggest lesson I learned after completing 55 boxes was that I KNEW NOTHING. I came to the realization that OSCP was just a tiny drop in the vast ocean of offensive security (not the company) and that the road ahead was much longer than I had imagined. I was feeling the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect in full force, constantly running into things I had never seen before: an exploit, a common misconfiguration, or even a simple fact about how Linux or Windows work. Every box taught me something new. That‚Äôs when it really hit me just how immense this field is, and it made me fall in love with offensive security (again, not the company) even more.\nSorry for going off track, lets get back to the roadmap.\nThe Roadmap (part 2) üõ§Ô∏è This was when I bought Offsec Playground subscription which allows you to do PG practice machines. I completed the following machines by end of August 2024:\naccess algernon astronaut authby blackgate boolean cockpit codo crane dvr4 exfiltrated extplorer glpi heist helpdesk hepet hub hutch image internal jacko kevin kyoto law nara pc pelican plum press pyloader resourced rubydome shenzi squid twiggy zipper After completing these 36 machines, I had completed around 91 machines in total, yet I still didn‚Äôt have the confidence to actually purchase the OffSec cert bundle, which would start a 90-day countdown for my exam.\nI did some research and found that the OffSec course material was not quite sufficient for the exam, but HTB Academy had some excellent modules for the OSCP exam under the ‚ÄúCPTS‚Äù course. So, I bought an HTB Academy subscription and, to my surprise, the course was brilliantly structured, and the exercises were fantastic. In hindsight, I probably should have gone through this course first before starting the boxes on HTB. This course really helped boost my exam confidence, and I would recommend it to everyone planning to take the exam. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it.\nThese were the modules I studied by topic:\nActive Directory Web Appplications Command Injections XSS File Inclusion File Uploads SQLI Web Proxies Web Attacks Privilege Escalation Windows (did not do Linux Privesc because I did not get time although I would recommend it) Miscellaneous Attacking Common Services (DNS, FTP, Redis, NFS‚Ä¶.) The Final Stretch üèÅ After completing this course, I finally purchased my 90-day lab access + exam bundle from OffSec on 2nd November 2024. I was already behind schedule and knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to meet my 31st December 2024 deadline. Still, I kept grinding as the clock began ticking toward my exam.\nI went through the course topic by topic, solving all the exercises. To be honest, I mostly skimmed through the material since much of it had already been covered in the HTB Academy course I completed earlier, and I made notes for any new concepts I hadn‚Äôt come across before.\nAfter finishing the exercises, I moved on to the labs, which were extremely important for the exam. Within the 90 days, I managed to complete all the labs except for the last two, but I was finally feeling confident enough to take the exam. My access ended on 31st January 2025, and I scheduled my exam for the last week\nThe Exam üñ•Ô∏è Finally, I sat for the exam at 9 am in the morning and decided to start with AD which I was already given initial access to. I had lost all hope by 1 PM because I had not found a single flag and had not managed to compromise even a single machine. I took a 15 minute breather and told my mom I was not going to pass.\nWhen I came back, I decided to forget everything I had done and start the exam all over again. This time, I pwned the first AD box within 30 minutes and after that, it was like a domino effect. By 4 PM, I had completed the entire AD challenge and took a 30 minute break.\nAfter coming back, I started with the standalones. To my surprise, I was able to pwn the first standalone withing the next 40 minutes. The second standalone took me some time but by 9 PM (exactly 12 hours after I started), I had 80 points in the bag which was enough to pass. I made a couple of failed attempts to complete the third standalone after another 30 minute break but I could not crack it because I was feeling very sleepy by that time. I decided to call it a day and went to sleep at about 11:30 PM and woke up at 5 AM to have one last crack at the last standalone. No luck. This was when I decided to re-solve all the completed boxes and take any screenshots I may have missed. Finally ended the exam by 8 am and started working on the report.\nThe Report üìÑ Since I had already prepared a template (which is very important to do) for the report and taken all the necessary screenshots, building the report wasn‚Äôt too difficult. It still took me about 5‚Äì6 hours to complete it after facing some technical issues. I waited a bit before submitting my report to ensure there was absolutely nothing missing.\nAfter submitting my report, I finally received the much-awaited email from OffSec on 4th March, informing me that I had passed the exam.\nA Few Tips üìù Make notes for each machine that you solve which will help you a LOT. Within each note, write detailed steps for the entire attack path and attach screenshots. Also write things you tried but did not work. After each box, review your notes and write down any new things you learned from that box.\nWhile making notes for boxes, also work on creating a checklist with all the commands for each step. This will be extremely helpful during the exam and will save you a lot of time and effort.\nGetting Help ü§ù Taking help is okay if you are stuck on a machine and absolutely cannot move forward but give yourself some time to think and dont immediately jump to the solutions. This will help you build the ‚ÄúTry Harder‚Äù mindset which is essential for the exam.\nSome youtube channels I would recommend are ippsec for HTB walkthroughs and John Hammond for tools. 0xdf‚Äôs blog is also very useful. Another useful website is ippsec.rocks where you can search any topic and find the exact timestamp for that topic in one of ippsec‚Äôs videos.\nTL;DR üìå OSCP is not a very challenging exam once you have a solid roadmap and good knowledge of the basics of penetration testing.\nChecklist for OSCP:\nHTB CPTS course 100 CTFs OSCP labs Try Harder. What‚Äôs Next? üîú After completing the OSCP, I feel like I can finally call myself a script kiddie. Now, it‚Äôs time to move on to more challenging things. I‚Äôm planning to take up OSWP next or maybe work on bug bounties for a while. Whatever I choose, I‚Äôll always keep this website updated.\n","wordCount":"1713","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-08-13T14:22:03Z","dateModified":"2025-08-13T14:22:03Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.notamaan.xyz/posts/my-oscp-experience/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"notamaan.xyz","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.notamaan.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.notamaan.xyz/ accesskey=h title="notamaan.xyz (Alt + H)">notamaan.xyz</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

I waited a bit before submitting my report to ensure there was absolutely nothing missing.</p><p>After submitting my report, I finally received the much-awaited email from OffSec on 4th March, informing me that I had passed the exam.</p><h3 id=a-few-tips->A Few Tips üìù<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-few-tips->#</a></h3><p>Make notes for each machine that you solve which will help you a LOT. Within each note, write detailed steps for the entire attack path and attach screenshots. Also write things you tried but did not work. After each box, review your notes and write down any new things you learned from that box.</p><p>While making notes for boxes, also work on creating a checklist with all the commands for each step. This will be extremely helpful during the exam and will save you a lot of time and effort.</p><p><img alt=tips loading=lazy src=https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExanp5bXFpZXFsbzRrbnQ3YWIyZ25yNGJqMDl2NHA4ZXlheHZxY3dsbyZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/1n833bZxdzKzaErLe9/giphy.gif></p><h3 id=getting-help->Getting Help ü§ù<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#getting-help->#</a></h3><p>Taking help is okay if you are stuck on a machine and absolutely cannot move forward but give yourself some time to think and dont immediately jump to the solutions. This will help you build the &ldquo;<strong>Try Harder</strong>&rdquo; mindset which is essential for the exam.</p><p>Some youtube channels I would recommend are <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@ippsec>ippsec</a> for HTB walkthroughs and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond>John Hammond</a> for tools. <a href=https://0xdf.gitlab.io/>0xdf&rsquo;s blog</a> is also very useful. Another useful website is <a href=https://ippsec.rocks/?#>ippsec.rocks</a> where you can search any topic and find the exact timestamp for that topic in one of ippsec&rsquo;s videos.</p><h3 id=tldr->TL;DR üìå<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tldr->#</a></h3><p>OSCP is not a very challenging exam once you have a solid roadmap and good knowledge of the basics of penetration testing.</p><p>Checklist for OSCP:</p><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> HTB CPTS course</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> 100 CTFs</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> OSCP labs</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> Try Harder.</li></ul><h3 id=whats-next->What&rsquo;s Next? üîú<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-next->#</a></h3><p>After completing the OSCP, I feel like I can finally call myself a script kiddie. Now, it‚Äôs time to move on to more challenging things. I‚Äôm planning to take up OSWP next or maybe work on bug bounties for a while. Whatever I choose, I‚Äôll always keep this website updated.</p><p><img alt=next loading=lazy src=https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeXpvM2Z1cXU5bW4ycXJpNHA4cmpycWgydnZmOHh6bmZneGZxOTQzdiZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/5UG0AFAcIlQoZIiOuN/giphy.gif></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://www.notamaan.xyz/>notamaan.xyz</a></span> ¬∑
